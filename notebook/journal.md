Today, I designed the first prototype of the index finger. This design will be the base of each finger besides the thumb.

Since fingers mainly move in I decided to use a resolute/hinge joint for each segment of the finger. For the pins of each hinge, I took inspiration from my school's VEX V5 team. We often use screws to act as pins for hinges, so I decided to use that in my design. I designed each hole to be 3.2mm to account for the tolerance of my 3D printer and used M3 screws.

Above, you can see a chart that shows the different muscles controlling your fingers. Something unique about the fingers is that there are no actual muscles located inside them. Instead, your body uses muscles in your forearm to move your fingers. These muscles pull on tendons which control how much your fingers are bent. To replicate this, I bought fishing line to act as the tendon and used servos I already had to act as the muscles.
