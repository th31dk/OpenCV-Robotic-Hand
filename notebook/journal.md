Today, I designed the first prototype of the index finger. This design will be the base of each finger besides the thumb.  

### CAD

Since fingers mainly move in I decided to use a resolute/hinge joint for each segment of the finger. For the pins of each hinge, I took inspiration from my school's VEX V5 team. We often use screws to act as pins for hinges, so I decided to use that in my design. I designed each hole to have a diameter of 3.2mm to account for the tolerance of my 3D printer and used M3 screws.

Above, you can see a chart that shows the different muscles controlling your fingers. Something unique about the fingers is that there are no actual muscles located inside them. Instead, your body uses muscles in your forearm to move your fingers. These muscles pull on tendons which control how much your fingers are bent. To replicate this, I bought fishing line to act as the tendons and used servos I already had to act as the muscles.

### Build
I sliced the 3D model in Bambu Slicer and used lightning infill because the printed model is just a prototype. I used black PLA for this, and it took approximately 20 minutes.  
After I was done printing it, I aligned all the segments together and put in a M3x20mm screw to act as the pin for the hinges. The screw didn't fit in that well so I drilled the hole with a 3mm drill bit. Tying the fishing line was definetly the hardest part because it didn't want to tie no matter what.

### Testing and Identifying Problems
#### Problem 1
I quickly realized that the finger had no way to lift back up after being pulled down.

#### Problem 2
I also noticed that I couldn't pull down if the finger was bent back

Today, I worked on the 3rd prototype of the index finger

## February 9th, 2026 - Monday
Today I worked on several of the journal entries because I forgot to do it.
