# Journal
Hey guys, this document will be where I track my progress on this project. 

## February 6th, 2026 - Friday
~1 hour of progress
Today, I designed the first prototype of the index finger. This design will be the base of each finger besides the thumb. On my team's VEX robot, we often use screws to act as a pin in a hinge, so I decided to implement that mechanism into my design.
